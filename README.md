# Exploratory Data Analysis on E-Commerce Business using Powerbi

##### This repository contains a project focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an e-commerce business dataset using Power BI. The goal of this project is to gain insights into the dataset, identify trends, spot anomalies, and generate visualizations that can help in making data-driven decisions.

## Introduction

##### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It allows data analysts and business stakeholders to understand the underlying patterns and structure of the data. This project leverages Power BI to perform EDA on an e-commerce business dataset.

## Dataset

Order ID
Product ID
Product Category
Order Date
Shipping Date
Customer ID
Customer Location
Quantity
Price
Revenue

## Analysis and Visualizations
The Power BI report includes several pages, each dedicated to a different aspect of the EDA. Some of the key analyses and visualizations include:

###### Sales Overview:
Total revenue, total orders, and average order value.
Sales trends over time (daily, monthly, yearly).

##### Product Analysis:
Top-selling products and categories.
Revenue contribution by product category.

##### Customer Analysis:
Geographic distribution of customers.
Customer segmentation based on purchase behavior.
